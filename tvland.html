The plan backfires on Mcleod when Shing Wauk goes crazy and starts letting arrows fly at his head. There is a funny story told to me by Eric's daughter about this episode. There was a scene where Shing Wauk has to put a knife into his mouth and climb up the fort's ladder. Well it happens that Eric's son was on set that day and was playing with this very knife which he accidentally dropped into some horse dung just before the scene was to be shot. Eric simply grabbed the knife and wiped it off and stuck it into his mouth- Yuck!!!!!</SPAN></FONT></B></TD>
